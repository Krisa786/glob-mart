## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Stock Reservation Strategy

**Approach:** Inventory reservations table (not direct stock decrement)
- Creates `inventory_reservations` records with 15-minute expiry
- Background job automatically releases expired reservations
- Prevents hard stock decrement before payment confirmation
- Supports multiple concurrent reservations

### Address Management

**Guest Users:**
- Creates temporary addresses for each checkout
- No persistence across sessions
- Full validation on each request

**Authenticated Users:**
- Attempts to find existing matching addresses
- Creates new addresses if no match found
- Links addresses to user account for future use

### Tax Calculation

**Multi-Country Support:**
- 20+ countries with accurate tax rates
- State/province tax calculation for US/Canada
- Business customer tax exemption
- Real-time rate calculation

### Shipping Calculation

**Zone-Based Pricing:**
- 7 shipping zones (domestic, europe, asia, etc.)
- Weight and value-based calculations
- Free shipping thresholds
- Method availability validation

### Session Management

**15-Minute Expiry:**
- Automatic expiry enforcement
- Background cleanup every 5 minutes
- Manual release capability
- Status tracking (active, completed, failed, expired)
