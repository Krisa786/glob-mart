## Seed Data Implementation

### Demo Data
- **File**: `src/database/seeders/20241220000001-demo-categories-and-products.js`
- **Content**:
  - 2 main categories: Hospitality Supplies, Healthcare Supplies
  - 5 subcategories with proper hierarchy
  - 11 demo products across all categories
  - Sample product images
  - Inventory records with random stock levels
  - Sustainability badges and metadata

- Automatic slug/SKU generation
- Multi-currency support
- Sustainability badge system
- JSON metadata storage
- Status workflow (draft → published → archived)

### 3. Inventory System
- Real-time stock tracking
- Low stock alerts
- Stock change audit trail
- Reserve/release functionality
- Stock history tracking

### 4. Media Management
- S3 integration ready
- Position-based image ordering
- Alt text for accessibility
- Dimension tracking

### 5. Search & Filtering
- Full-text search across multiple fields
- Category filtering
- Price range filtering
- Brand filtering
- Stock status filtering
- Sustainability badge filtering

## Database Indexes

### Performance Optimizations
- Unique constraints on slugs and SKUs
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Foreign key indexes
- Status and deleted_at indexes
- Path and level indexes for category queries

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Category Management
- Circular reference prevention
- Orphaned category handling
- Product reassignment on category deletion
- Slug collision resolution

### 2. Product Management
- Soft delete with inventory preservation
- Slug/SKU collision resolution
- Category validation
- Stock consistency

### 3. Inventory Management

- Circular reference prevention
- Path and level updates on category moves

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@host:port/database
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=your-jwt-public-key
S3_BUCKET_URL=https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
TZ=UTC
```

## Migration Commands

### Run Migrations
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### Run Seeders
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### Rollback (if needed)
```bash
npm run db:migrate:undo
```

## Next Steps

### Sprint 2 Integration
1. Implement API controllers using the services
2. Add validation middleware
3. Implement search indexing (Meilisearch/Elasticsearch)
4. Add media upload endpoints
5. Implement caching layer
6. Add API documentation

### Performance Considerations
1. Implement database read replicas for search queries
2. Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
3. Implement pagination for large result sets
4. Add database query optimization
5. Implement background jobs for heavy operations
